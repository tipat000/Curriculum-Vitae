       My hot water suit is still dripping from the last dive and it's my turn again. Few piles to line up, jacks to weld,<br/>
       come alongs to crank and I am out. The client needed divers to go line up and secure the bottom part of a guide<br/>
       that will help to drill straight into the seabed. That forty-five feet deep dive on Air would only allow for a maximum<br/>
       of two hours and forty minutes of bottom time and would require twenty-four minutes of in water decompression at<br/>
       10 feet. I'm glad we are using nitrox. Not only we can do our full four hours dives with no decompression, but we come<br/>
       out of it fresh.</p>

        I put a lot of time and effort every single day in order to improve my skills in web development. All that<br/>
        construction lingo above may not mean much to you, but the point I'm trying to get across is that troubleshooting and<br/>
        building stuff have always been a part of my everyday life.<br/>
